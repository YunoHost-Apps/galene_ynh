## Overview

Galène (or Galene) is a videoconference server (an “SFU”) that is easy to deploy and that requires moderate server resources. It was originally designed for lectures and conferences (where a single speaker streams audio and video to hundreds or thousands of users), but later evolved to be useful for student practicals (where users are divided into many small groups), and meetings (where a dozen users interact with each other).

**Shipped version:** 0.4.0~ynh1

**Demo:** https://galene.org:8443/

## Disclaimers / important information

### Accessing groups

*Galène* meeting rooms are called "groups". Any group is accessible at `https://domain.tld/group/GroupName`, by typing its name in the home page search field, or by selecting it in the public list (if the group is configured as publicly visible, see below).

#### Creating and configuring groups

Groups are defined by JSON files located in the *Galène* folder (`/opt/yunohost/galene/groups`). Each group is represented by a `GroupName.json` file.
To create a new group, you need to create a `GroupNameExample.json` file (you can also make subfolder groups, and the groups will be accessible with `https://domain.tld/group/subfolder/GroupName`). Various configuration options are available (see https://github.com/YunoHost-Apps/galene_ynh/wiki/Configuration-file).

*NB: spaces are supported in group file names.*

### Configuring your TURN server

#### Using *Galène*'s TURN server
Galène comes with a built-in TURN server that should work out-of-the-box.
- If your server is behind NAT, allow incoming traffic to TCP port `8443` (or whatever is configured with the `-http` option in `/etc/systemd/system/galene.service`) and TCP/UDP port `1194` (or whatever is configured with the `-turn` option in `/etc/systemd/system/galene.service`)

#### Using your own TURN server
- Install [coturn_ynh](https://github.com/YunoHost-Apps/coturn_ynh).
- Add `/opt/yunohost/galene/data/ice-servers.json` with these lines and change `turn.example.org` and `secret`

```
    [
        {
            "urls": [
                "turn:turn.example.org:5349",
                "turn:turn.example.org:5349?transport=tcp"
            ],
            "username": "galene",
            "credential": "secret"
        }
    ]
```
- set `/etc/systemd/system/galene.service` `-turn` option to `-turn auto` (or `-turn ""` to disable the built-in TURN server).

To check if the TURN server is up and running, type `/relay-test` in the chat box. If the TURN server is properly configured, you should see a message saying that the relay test has been successful.

### Server Statistics page

Some statistics are available under `/opt/yunohost/galene/stats.json`, with a human-readable version at `domain.ltd/stats.html`. This is only available to the server administrator.
